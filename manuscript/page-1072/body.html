The next step is to reproduce, as nearly as we can, the domestic circumstances which surrounded you last year.”</p><p>How was this to be done? Lady Verinder was dead.

It was simply impossible to reassemble the people who had inhabited the house, when I had slept in it last. The statement of this objection did not appear to embarrass Ezra Jennings. He attached very little importance, he said, to reassembling the same people—seeing that it would be vain to expect them to reassume the various positions which they had occupied towards me in the past times. On the other hand, he considered it essential to the success of the experiment, that I should see the same objects about me which had surrounded me when I was last in the house.</p></div> </div>
