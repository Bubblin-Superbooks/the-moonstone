<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">lady, “I should like to ask a favour. Mr. Jennings is about to try a scientific experiment tonight. I used to attend scientific experiments when I was a girl at school. They invariably ended in an explosion. If Mr. Jennings will be so very kind, I should like to be warned of the explosion this time. With a view to getting it over, if possible, before I go to bed.”</p><p>I attempted to assure Mrs. Merridew that an explosion was not included in the programme on this occasion.</p><p>“No,” said the old lady. “I am much obliged to Mr. Jennings—I am aware that he is only deceiving me for my own good. I prefer plain dealing. I am quite resigned to the explosion—but I <em>do</em> want to get it over, if possible, before I go to bed.”</p><p>Here the door opened, and Mrs. Merridew uttered another little scream. The advent of the explosion? No: only the advent of Betteredge.</p></div> </div>
