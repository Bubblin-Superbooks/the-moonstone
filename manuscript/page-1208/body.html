That was the time when he left word, last night, that he was to be called. He <em>was</em> called—and there was no getting an answer from him, and no opening his door to see what was the matter. They tried again at eight, and they tried again at nine. No use! There was the door still locked—and not a sound to be heard in the room! I have been out this morning—and I only got back a quarter of an hour ago. I have hammered at the door myself—and all to no purpose. The potboy has gone to fetch a carpenter. If you can wait a few minutes, gentlemen, we will have the door opened, and see what it means.”</p><p>“Was the man drunk last night?” asked Sergeant Cuff.</p><p>“Perfectly sober, sir—or I would never have let him sleep in my house.”</p></div> </div>
