(1849.)</h3><p class="  start-chapter">I am requested by Sergeant Cuff to set in writing certain facts, concerning three men (believed to be Hindoos) who were passengers, last summer, in the ship <em>Bewley Castle</em>, bound for Bombay direct, under my command.</p><p>The Hindoos joined us at Plymouth. On the passage out I heard no complaint of their conduct. They were berthed in the forward part of the vessel. I had but few occasions myself of personally noticing them.</p></div> </div>
