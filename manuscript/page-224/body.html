It was sunrise before I fell off at last into a sleep. All the time I lay awake the house was as quiet as the grave. Not a sound stirred but the splash of the rain, and the sighing of the wind among the trees as a breeze sprang up with the morning.</p><p>About half-past seven I woke, and opened my window on a fine sunshiny day. The clock had struck eight, and I was just going out to chain up the dogs again, when I heard a sudden whisking of petticoats on the stairs behind me.</p><p>I turned about, and there was Penelope flying down after me like mad. “Father!” she screamed, “come upstairs, for God’s sake! _The Diamond is gone!_”</p><p>“Are you out of your mind?” I asked her.</p><p>“Gone!” says Penelope. “Gone, nobody knows how! Come up and see.”</p></div> </div>
