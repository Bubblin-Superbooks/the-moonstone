<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">son! I know it as certainly as if you had confessed it in so many words. Your cursed family pride is insulting Godfrey, as it insulted <em>me</em> when I married your aunt. Her family—her beggarly family—turned their backs on her for marrying an honest man, who had made his own place and won his own fortune. I had no ancestors. I wasn’t descended from a set of cut-throat scoundrels who lived by robbery and murder. I couldn’t point to the time when the Ablewhites hadn’t a shirt to their backs, and couldn’t sign their own names. Ha! ha! I wasn’t good enough for the Herncastles, when <em>I</em> married. And now, it comes to the pinch, my son isn’t good enough for <em>you</em>. I suspected it, all along. You have got the Herncastle blood in you, my young lady! I suspected it all along.”</p><p>“A very unworthy suspicion,” remarked Mr. Bruff. “I am astonished that you have the courage to acknowledge it.”</p></div> </div>
